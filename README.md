:heavy_check_mark: Made in Python;\
:heavy_check_mark: Made with security and optimization as a priority;\
:heavy_check_mark: Under active development;

## Stack ##

The following tools were used in this project:

- [Python 3.11+](https://python.org)
- [Sanic 23.3](https://sanic.dev)
- [Redis 6.0.16+](https://github.com/redis/redis)
- [MariaDB 10.11.3](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/10.11.3/)
- [Discommand dev branch](https://github.com/Serbirial/DisCommand)
- [Discord.py Latest](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- [PM2 Latest](https://pm2.keymetrics.io)
  
##  Requirements ##

Before starting, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python](https://python.org/) installed, along with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io).

## Starting ##

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/Serbirial/lana-py

# Access
$ cd lana-py

# Clone my discord.py wrapper and rename it for the bot to use (CANT SKIP) 
$ git clone -b dev https://github.com/Serbirial/DisCommand && mv discommand dis_command

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project
$ pm2 start

# Make sure to configure the bot, including Redis and mariaDB!
```


Make sure you setup the database (MariaDB) with the schema files in the [Schema](https://github.com/Serbirial/lana-py/blob/main/config/schema.sql) file.

If you need any help, or have questions, or just want to join and chat, feel free to join Lana's community discord https://discord.gg/Ae8sH5qYVX.

## Disclaimer!! ##
The main branch of Lana AR will be considered a rolling release until an official release is put in the releases section.\
After the first stable release; the main branch will go back to being a mostly-stable release of the bot, and a dev branch will be made in its place.\
We say Lana is 90% open source because we keep certain features entirely private code-wise to prevent both code theft and attackers from knowing very intricately how the bot's internals works.
### This includes: 
*	Any/All Auto-Mod/Events: antispam, welcoming, logging, anything of the sorts. (Will slowly trickle viable features in)
*	The antilock code to entirely prevent raids/spam from disrupting/DDoSing the bot (relatively simple should you want to implement it yourself and are intermediate at python, just go from what you see left in the bot)
*	Any/All code that enables or adds payment processing/monitization to the bot.

I will provide limited support with how to implement some of these features yourself.

### Version Bumping through PR titles
Our repository uses an automated versioning system that relies on the naming convention of the pull request titles. When you merge a pull request into the dev branch, the version number of the project is automatically bumped and a new tag is created, based on the prefix in your PR title.

The version number follows the MAJOR.MINOR.FIX format, where:

MAJOR version increments indicate significant changes or enhancements in the project, often including breaking changes.
MINOR version increments indicate backwards-compatible new features or enhancements.
FIX version increments indicate backwards-compatible bug fixes or minor changes.
To specify the type of changes you have made in your pull request, prefix your PR title with one of the following:

major: - to increment the MAJOR version (e.g., from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0).
minor: - to increment the MINOR version (e.g., from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0).
fix: - to increment the FIX version (e.g., from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2).
For example, if you have made a minor change, your PR title could be: minor: Add new feature XYZ.

If your PR title does not include any of the specified prefixes, the GitHub Action will not increment the version or create a new tag. This can be useful for non-functional changes like updates to documentation or code refactoring that don't require a version bump.

When your PR is merged into main, the GitHub Action will increment the version according to the prefix in the PR title and create a new tag.

Please ensure you follow this convention to maintain a well-structured and meaningful version history for our project.
